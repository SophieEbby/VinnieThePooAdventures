            <p>Hi, I’m Sophie – proud dog mum to Vinnie, our lovable F1 Cavapoo (or Cavoodle for our Aussie friends!). Vinnie was born on 10th December 2021 in the UK, one of six adorable pups (three boys and three girls). From the moment he joined our family, life has been filled with joy, adventures, and plenty of cuddles.
            </p>

                style="max-width: 400px;">

            <p>Becoming a first-time dog mum has been an incredible journey. My partner and I have learned so much “on the job” with Vinnie leading the way! From those early puppy days to our everyday adventures, caring for Vinnie has sparked a passion I never knew I had – the joy of exploring the world through his eyes.</p>

            <p>What started as a simple way to share Vinnie’s milestones with friends and family soon grew into something more. We created @itsVinnieThePoo on Instagram to connect with fellow dog lovers and share the ups, downs, and unforgettable moments of life with a Cavapoo. Now, this space is all about celebrating the bond between humans and their furry best friends. </p>

            <p>Here, you’ll find our story, our favourite UK & Australia walks, road trips, tips & tricks for fellow dog parents, and all the fun adventures we get up to together. Whether you’re a seasoned pet parent or just starting your journey, we hope to inspire, share, and make you smile – one wagging tail at a time.</p>

            <h2 class="lead">Our Journey to Australia</h2>
            <p>In 2025, we migrated from the UK to Australia to start an exciting new chapter in our lives. The journey wasn’t simple – it took over a year of planning, from the moment we made the decision to the day we finally touched down. There was a mountain of paperwork, countless vet visits, multiple vaccinations, and travel arrangements for Vinnie. It was a lot of work, but we were determined to make it happen. </p>

            <p>Vinnie had to go through an extensive preparation process, including numerous vaccinations and a 30-day quarantine at a specialist facility in Melbourne. In total, he took three flights from London Heathrow all the way to the Gold Coast, Australia! We couldn’t have done it without the incredible team at PetAir UK, who handled the paperwork and most of the logistics, making an overwhelming process so much easier for us (and for Vinnie!).</p>

            <p>Now, we’re exploring the beautiful Australian landscapes together, from stunning beaches to lush national parks. Vinnie has adapted wonderfully to his new home, and we can’t wait to share our adventures with you. Join us as we discover the best walks, dog-friendly spots, and everything else this amazing country has to offer!</p>
