            <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
            <p>This page is dedicated to sharing useful tips and tricks for dog owners in Australia, specifically the
                Gold Coast.</p>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>Tip 1: Register Your Dog</strong><br>
                In the Gold Coast, it is a legal requirement to register your dog with your local council. Registration
                helps reunite you with your pet if they get lost and ensures compliance with local regulations.
                Registration usually needs to be renewed annually, and discounts often apply for desexed dogs or
                pensioners. You can register online via the Gold Coast City Council website.
                <a href="https://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/Services/Animals-pets/Register-your-dog"
                    target="_blank">Register your dog online here</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>Tip 2: Keep Dogs on a Leash in Public Areas</strong><br>
                Dogs must be on a leash in all public places unless you are in a designated off-leash area. Off-leash
                areas are specifically marked and safe for your dog to run freely. Check council maps or apps to locate
                these zones. Always carry a leash and waste bags to clean up after your dog.
                Check the <a
                    href="https://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/Services/Animals-pets/Dog-exercise-areas/Dog-exercise-area-map"
                    target="_blank">official list of off-leash areas</a> to find safe zones near you.

                <strong>Tip 3: Consider a Greencross Healthy Pets Plus Subscription</strong><br>
                This is a membership program offered by Greencross Vets that provides unlimited vet consultations,
                discounted products, and other benefits for a monthly fee. One major advantage is that there are no
                consultation fees for non-emergency visits, which can save you money over time. Members also get
                discounts on parasite prevention, vaccinations, and food.

            <li>
                <strong>Tip 4: Microchip Your Dog</strong><br>
                Microchipping is mandatory in Queensland. Make sure your contact details are current.

            <li>
                <strong>Tip 5: Tick and Flea Prevention</strong><br>
                The Gold Coast is a high-risk area for paralysis ticks. Talk to your vet about the best protection for
                your dog.

            <h2>Tricks</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>Trick 1: Take Advantage of Petbarn’s Price Match Policy</strong><br>
                Petbarn will match the price of any identical product found at a competitor (including online stores).
                This means you can often get the lowest price without having to shop around at multiple stores. Just
                show proof of the competitor’s price (e.g., a photo or website link) when making your purchase.
                <a href="https://www.petbarn.com.au/price-guarantee" target="_blank">See Petbarn's Price Match
                    Policy</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>Trick 2: Free Poo Bags in Public Places</strong><br>
                Many parks and public areas on the Gold Coast provide free dog waste bags. Look for dispensers at
                popular dog walking spots such as beaches, off-leash parks, and council-managed reserves. This not only
                helps you keep the environment clean but also saves you money on buying bags. An on-the-spot fine may
                apply if you do not dispose of your dog's waste properly in public.
